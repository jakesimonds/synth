code/keyboard.ino contains the code I show in class. This is object-oriented, ended up being a lot easier to code up and makes a device that's a lot easier to intentionally make interesting sounds with (though the keyboard can be buggy). 

code/drone.ino contains the threading code. I show the functionality of this code in my 2 minute demo video, the code is messy though and I still haven't gotten exactly what I wanted out of it (& switched gears to the keyboard.ino code when that was more promising (though that was before setbacks with the physcial keyboard...))
